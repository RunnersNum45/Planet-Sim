# Planet-Sim
A 2D gravitational simulation

A python simulation of gravity in only two dimensions.

Currently the latest build is Planets-2
Click to add a new planet, drag when adding to give the new planet a speed.
The top slider changes G (the gravitational constant), the bottom slider changes fps although it only really slow it down in the lower numbers.

Sorry for all the spaghetti.
